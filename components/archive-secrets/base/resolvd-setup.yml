# The point of this deamonset is to ensure that when we mount the archive that the
# DistributedFS calls can resolve using the isis.cclrc.ac.uk as an additional search
# Without this change on the nodes the archive DFS calls will fail as it will attempt to
# just use isisdatar55, isisdatar3, or isisdatar80, which will fail without the added
# search domain: isis.cclrc.ac.uk. This is a more hacky solution than is ideal, in the
# best scenario a fix would be properly implemented on the side of the Archive.
# However, this works.

# This finishes its job after init, and afterward it is just a paused container that
# does nothing.
