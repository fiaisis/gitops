# What's going on here?

## Why is ceph different than other components?

There is no base here, because the deployment for staging and production is extemely different (using our own ceph cluster in staging), we will have some duplication here, but that is fine.

## Why bother with the overlays dir?

To keep the structure similar to other components and just keep the application definitions simple
