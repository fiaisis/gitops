                  For configuration parameters not exposed, a map can be provided for string values.
                  Such values are passed transparently to Redpanda. The key format is "<subsystem>.field", e.g.,

                  additionalConfiguration:

                  Notes:
                  1. versioning is not supported for map keys
                  2. key names not supported by Redpanda will lead to failure on start up
                  3. updating this map requires a manual restart of the Redpanda pods. Please be aware of
                  sync period when one Redpanda POD is restarted
                  4. cannot have keys that conflict with existing struct fields - it leads to panic

                  By default if Replicas is 3 or more and redpanda.default_topic_partitions is not set
                  default webhook is setting redpanda.default_topic_partitions to 3.

                          For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:

                          index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of

                                EndpointTemplate is a Golang template string that allows customizing each

                                Redpanda uses the format BROKER_ID.SUBDOMAIN:EXTERNAL_KAFKA_API_PORT by
                                default for advertised addresses. When an EndpointTemplate is
                                provided, then the BROKER_ID part is replaced with the endpoint
                                computed from the template.
                                The following variables are available to the template:
                                - Index: the Redpanda broker progressive number
                                - HostIP: the ip address of the Node, as reported in pod status

                                are also available. The set of available functions is limited to hermetic
                                functions because template application needs to be deterministic.

                                EndpointTemplate is a Golang template string that allows customizing each
                                broker advertised address.
                                Redpanda uses the format BROKER_ID.SUBDOMAIN:EXTERNAL_KAFKA_API_PORT by
                                default for advertised addresses. When an EndpointTemplate is
                                provided, then the BROKER_ID part is replaced with the endpoint
                                computed from the template.
                                The following variables are available to the template:
                                - Index: the Redpanda broker progressive number
                                - HostIP: the ip address of the Node, as reported in pod status

                                Common template functions from Sprig (http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/)
                                are also available. The set of available functions is limited to hermetic
                                functions because template application needs to be deterministic.

                                EndpointTemplate is a Golang template string that allows customizing each
                                broker advertised address.
                                Redpanda uses the format BROKER_ID.SUBDOMAIN:EXTERNAL_KAFKA_API_PORT by
                                default for advertised addresses. When an EndpointTemplate is
                                provided, then the BROKER_ID part is replaced with the endpoint
                                computed from the template.
                                The following variables are available to the template:
                                - Index: the Redpanda broker progressive number
                                - HostIP: the ip address of the Node, as reported in pod status

                                Common template functions from Sprig (http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/)
                                are also available. The set of available functions is limited to hermetic
                                functions because template application needs to be deterministic.

                              EndpointTemplate is a Golang template string that allows customizing each
                              broker advertised address.
                              Redpanda uses the format BROKER_ID.SUBDOMAIN:EXTERNAL_KAFKA_API_PORT by
                              default for advertised addresses. When an EndpointTemplate is
                              provided, then the BROKER_ID part is replaced with the endpoint
                              computed from the template.
                              The following variables are available to the template:
                              - Index: the Redpanda broker progressive number
                              - HostIP: the ip address of the Node, as reported in pod status

                              Common template functions from Sprig (http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/)
                              are also available. The set of available functions is limited to hermetic
                              functions because template application needs to be deterministic.

                                Redpanda uses the format BROKER_ID.SUBDOMAIN:EXTERNAL_KAFKA_API_PORT by
                                default for advertised addresses. When an EndpointTemplate is
                                provided, then the BROKER_ID part is replaced with the endpoint
                                computed from the template.
                                The following variables are available to the template:
                                - Index: the Redpanda broker progressive number
                                - HostIP: the ip address of the Node, as reported in pod status

                                are also available. The set of available functions is limited to hermetic
                                functions because template application needs to be deterministic.

                      restarts. The procedure can be described as follows:

                      1. Rolling update checks if Pod specification needs to be replaced and deletes it
                      2. Deleted Redpanda Pod is put into maintenance mode (postStart hook will disable
                         maintenance mode when new Pod starts)
                      3. Rolling update waits for Pod to be in Ready state
                      4. Rolling update checks if cluster is in healthy state
                      5. Rolling update checks if restarted Redpanda Pod admin API Ready endpoint returns HTTP 200 response
                      6. Using UnderReplicatedPartitionThreshold each under replicated partition metric is compared with the threshold
                      7. Rolling update moves to the next Redpanda pod

                      The metric `vectorized_cluster_partition_under_replicated_replicas` is used in the comparison

                      Mentioned metrics has the following help description:
                      `vectorized_cluster_partition_under_replicated_replicas` Number of under replicated replicas

                      By default, the UnderReplicatedPartitionThreshold will be 0, which means all partitions needs to catch up without any lag.

                        Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                        tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                                If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                                should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                                For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                                "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                                the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                                index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                                referencing a part of an object.

                          To use a KMS key in a different account, use the key ARN or the alias ARN.

                          If you don't specify this value, then Secrets Manager uses the key aws/secretsmanager.

                      so that one secret store can be used by multiple tenants.
                      For AWS it's common to use a path-like structure whereas GCP does not
                      allow slashes.

                      Examples:
                      AWS: redpanda/analytics/prod/console/
                      GCP: redpanda-analytics-prod-console-

                      Changing this prefix won't let you access secrets created under
                      a different prefix.

                      Setting the `useFlux` flag to `false` disables the Helm controller's reconciliation of the Helm chart.
                      This ties the operator to a specific version of the Go-based Redpanda Helm chart, causing all other
                      ChartRef fields to be ignored.

                      Before disabling `useFlux`, ensure that your `chartVersion` is aligned with `5.9.21` or the corresponding
                      version of the Redpanda chart.

                      Note: When `useFlux` is set to `false`, `RedpandaStatus` may become inaccurate if the HelmRelease is
                      manually deleted.

                      To dynamically switch Flux controllers (HelmRelease and HelmRepository), setting `useFlux` to `false`
                      will suspend these resources instead of removing them.

                      are not available in the `RedpandaClusterSpec`. These values
                      have no impact on the configuration or behavior of the Kubernetes
                      objects deployed by Helm, and therefore should not be modified
                      for the purpose of configuring those objects. Instead, these
                      settings get passed directly to the Redpanda binary at startup.

                                            incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                            to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                            for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                            pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                            The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                            Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                            This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.

                                                    don't ONLY use UUIDs, this is an alias to string.  Being a type captures
                                                    intent and helps make sure that UIDs and names do not get conflated.

                      Setting the `useFlux` flag to `false` disables the Helm controller's reconciliation of the Helm chart.
                      This ties the operator to a specific version of the Go-based Redpanda Helm chart, causing all other
                      ChartRef fields to be ignored.

                      Before disabling `useFlux`, ensure that your `chartVersion` is aligned with `5.9.21` or the corresponding
                      version of the Redpanda chart.

                      Note: When `useFlux` is set to `false`, `RedpandaStatus` may become inaccurate if the HelmRelease is
                      manually deleted.

                      To dynamically switch Flux controllers (HelmRelease and HelmRepository), setting `useFlux` to `false`
                      will suspend these resources instead of removing them.

                                        MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                        be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                        to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                        for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                        pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                        The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
